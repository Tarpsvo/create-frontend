# Universal React App

This template will set up a React project that renders on both the client and server with Node.js.
It comes with React-Router by default.

Some of the configuration options have different default values. The client entry point is now in _/app/client.js_

There are some additional configuration options:

-   `serverEntryPoint` (_/app/server.js_) - Entry point for your server.
