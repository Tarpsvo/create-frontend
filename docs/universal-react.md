# Universal React App

This template will set up a React project that renders on both the client and server with Node.js.

It comes with some extra features by default:

-   [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
-   [inline-react-svg plugin](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-inline-react-svg) for easily rendering SVGs

There is an additional CLI scripts:

-   `npm run start` - Starts the production server

There are some additional configuration options:

-   `serverEntryPoint` (_server/entry.js_) - Entry point for your server.
-   `serverBuildPath` (_server/build_) - Where the compiled server will be built. Relative to project root.
